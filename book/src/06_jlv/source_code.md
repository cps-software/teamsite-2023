# Source Code

## Clone to Local Dev Environment
JLV source code downloaded from the develop-react-refactor branch
 - For testing your build, this base branch will work
 - For doing story work, create a feature or bugfix branch based off of it

Since Steven has done some maintenance of jlv-code, I did a full clone from the **_main_** branch.

2/23/22 update:
David’s confluence page now states:
 - JLV code downloaded from the latest 3.0 branch
    - For testing your build, this base branch will work. For doing story work, create a feature or bugfix branch based off of it.

I asked David to clarify, and he confirmed that we can simply clone the jlv-code repository and then work from whatever branch is desired locally. For example, he mentioned using “develop” as the base branch from which we branch from for our specific work.

Here's what I did:  
```
git clone https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/jlv-code.git
```

## Integrated Development Environment (IDE)
Install and set up an IDE.  

- IntelliJ Community Edition is used by most of the JLV devs, but any TRM approved IDE will work
- I plan to use Visual Studio Code
