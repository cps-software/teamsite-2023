# Apache Groovy

[groovy-lang.org](https://groovy-lang.org/index.html)

David's instructions indicate Groovy 3.0.7  
The currently available 3.x version is Groovy 3.0.8 (or higher)  

Downloaded and unzipped: groovy-3.0.8  
Unzipped in the Downloads folder  
Copied folder to /Library

### CPS Note (10/8/22)
I believe I used `~/swtool` as the location on my BAH MBP.  
So, update all references of `/Library` to `~/swtool` for BAH MBP.  

### Validate Groovy Installation
The following information is from [groovy-lang.org/install](https://groovy-lang.org/install.html)

Validate Groovy install by typing the following in a command shell:
```
groovysh
```

Which should create an interactive groovy shell that accepts Groovy statements.

To run the Swing interactive console type:
```
groovyConsole
```

To run a specific Groovy script type:
```
groovy SomeScript
```
