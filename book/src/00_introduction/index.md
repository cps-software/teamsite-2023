# Introduction
**Teamsite** is a collaboration site that helps software development teams build great products. It is both a project management and an engineering methodology tool. It provides flexibility while also being somewhat opinionated in the overall execution process.

Teamsite is geared towards development teams who rarely work together in a face-to-face setting. It's primary objective is to capture and make available everything a team needs to know to work productively in a remote and distributed environment. Most information is organized in a hierarchical fashion, making it easy to find topics, such as a specific project or work team, and then drill down to find details that can be reviewed, updated, and acted upon.
